The plugin enables the WordPress website to support logging in, safely and securely, by scanning a QR code, using the Global Input App on your mobile.


== Description ==
"WP GlobalInput Login" plugin, enables the WordPress website to support the Global Input App(for more details see the GitHub repo at https://github.com/global-input/wordpress-login or at https://globalinput.co.uk). After activating the plugin, you should see a QR code on top of the sign in form. When you scan the QR Code with Global Input App, on your mobile device, you can type on your mobile to fill in the Sign In form on your computer. After saving the form data for the first time use, next time you can speed up the login process by selecting the data to fill in the form.
